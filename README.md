# Valentine
Cute way to ask out your partner this valentine.
Just download the files, type npx create-react-app valentine,
copy paste the components folder in the src of your created react app.
type npm start, that will run the app in localhost 3000.
Enjoy!

make sure you have npm, react, javascript installed in your local!
